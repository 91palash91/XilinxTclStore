
Description: 

    Implements and generates bit stream of a 2RP synthesized design.

Arguments:

    <pr_config> - (Required) Partial configuration for the implementation run.

    <output_dir> - (Required) Directory to save the results.
    
    -exclude_constrs - (Optional) List of constraint file to be excluded from generation of bit files.

    -shell - (Optional) RL/Shell instance path. Must be mentioned in case rl_platform_dcp option is not provided.

    -base_platform_dcp - (Optional) Base platform dcp file, contains only static routed region.
    
    -rl_platform_dcp - (Optional) Reconfigurable logic platform dcp file.   
    
    -post_link_design_hook - (Optional) List of tcl commands to execute post link design for bit generation step.

    -opt_directive - (Optional) Directive for opt design step.

    -place_directive - (Optional) Directive for place design step.

    -route_directive - (Optional) Directive for route design step.

    -phys_opt_directive - (Optional) Directive for phys opt design step.

    -generate_dsa - (Optional) Generates DSA.
    
Examples:

    Below examples are based on a design which has a 'top' bd, 'top' bd has a module reference to a partition def 'wrapper' as 'wrapper_def_0',
    'wrapper_def_0' has two module references to partition defs 'dynamic' and 'shell' as 'dynamic_region' and 'shell_region' respectively. 

    1. The following example generates everything base platform, rl platform, full and partial bitstreams.
       One need to have a Pblock for wrapper_def_0 inside an xdc file that contains everything except the static. 
       One need to specify this file in exclude_constrs switch (here rest.xdc).

       % xilinx::x2rp::run -pr_config {top_i/wrapper_def_0:w1 top_i/wrapper_def_0/dynamic_region:user top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region:design_2} -output_dir ./output -exclude_constrs [get_files rest.xdc] -shell top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region

    2. The following example generates everything rl platform, full and partial bitstreams (starts from post base platform generation step).
       Note: If you have a Pblock for wrapper_def_0, you need to exclude it using exclude_constrs switch.

       % xilinx::x2rp::run -pr_config {top_i/wrapper_def_0:w1 top_i/wrapper_def_0/dynamic_region:user top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region:design_2} -output_dir ./output/ -base_platform_dcp ./output/base_platform.dcp -shell top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region

    3. The following example generates everything full and partial bitstreams (starts from post rl platform generation step).
       Note: If you have a Pblock for wrapper_def_0, you need to exclude it using exclude_constrs switch.

       % xilinx::x2rp::run -pr_config {top_i/wrapper_def_0:w1 top_i/wrapper_def_0/dynamic_region:user top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region:design_2} -output_dir ./output/ -rl_platform_dcp ./output/platform.dcp 
    
    4. The following example generates everything full and partial bitstreams and also executes post link design hook script (starts from post rl platform generation step).
       Note: If you have a Pblock for wrapper_def_0, you need to exclude it using exclude_constrs switch.

       % xilinx::x2rp::run -pr_config {top_i/wrapper_def_0:w1 top_i/wrapper_def_0/dynamic_region:user top_i/wrapper_def_0/shell_region:design_2} -output_dir ./output/ -rl_platform_dcp ./output/platform.dcp -post_link_design_hook {"set_param hd.skipPartitionPinReductionOnCell top_i/wrapper_def_0/dynamic_region"}
